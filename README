Property Lists were a configuration file format commonly used in the OpenStep framework. Currently, Apple has updated Property Lists to be XML-based, but Cocoa still supports the old-style Property Lists as well.

Property Lists are also available to the GNUStep libraries.

All suggestions to improve this syntax file are welcome.
